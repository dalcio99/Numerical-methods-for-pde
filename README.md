# Numerical-methods-for-pde

These are a selection of exercises extracted from the first project of my 'Computational Methods in Finance' course, which I undertook at the 'Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico' in Lisbon during the second semester of my first year of Master's studies in Spring 2022. This project marked one of my initial experiences with coding and served as my introduction to Python. Therefore, there may be opportunities to optimize the code and improve its clarity.

For better compilation and reproduction, I recommend using either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

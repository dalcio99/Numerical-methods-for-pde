# Numerical-methods-for-pde
First project of the course "Computational methods in Finance", that I attended at "Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico of Lisbon" during my Erasmus during the second semester of my first Master's year (Spring 2022).  I did it in a rush as always, and it was my first coding project (and first time using python too)  so the implementation is very 'paleolitic' and ugly.
